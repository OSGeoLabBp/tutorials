Measure point with slope prism rod
==================================

To measure a point for example on a vertical plan with a total station can be done by
measuring three or four different points fixing the rod end at the point of 
interest. Three points are enough if the rod length is known.

The circuscribed circle through the three points is a section of the sphere. There are two possible solutions.
