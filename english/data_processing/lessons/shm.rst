Elisabeth bridge is one of the bridges over the Danube at Budapest.
We would like to find the relation between bus passes on the bud and the
deflection at the middle of the bridge.

Sensors
-------

* Robotic total station (RTS)
* GNSS
* Pi camera for movement detection
* Action camera for bus detection (image + sound)
